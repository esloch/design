**Resolution**


## Abstract

...

## Motivation

...

## Proposal

**Key points:**

* General Definition
* Visibility
* Attributes and Type Annotation
* Methods and Type Annotation
  * Regular Methods
  * Static Methods
  * Methods Decoration
  * Core methods
* Inheritance
* Template class
* Interface
* Instantiation
* Docstrings

**Conventions**

In this proposal, some examples use placeholders by adding a name inside `<>`
(e.g. `class <ClassName>`), it means that `<className>` should be replaced by
a name that will identify that class, for example, `class MyClass`.
Placeholders can be written using `CamelCase` or `snake_case` or, simply,
using words separated by dash (e.g. `block-of-code`) but it is not
stricted to values in this style.

Optional parameters are represented by `[]`, for example:
`[public] class <ClassName>`. It means that you can ommit `public` keyword
before the class statement. If there are more options for this section,
it can be expressed using `|`, for example: `[ public | protected | private]`.
If there is a default value when this section is ommited, it can be expressed
using `*`, for example: `[ public* | protected | private]`.

Also, it is possible to combine placeholders with optional values,
for example:
`[<visibility: public* | protected | private >] class <ClassName>:`
and it will match the follow statement:
`public class MyPublicClass:` as well as
`class MyPublicClass:`.

When a section can have more items using the same pattern, it can use the
`...` notation. For example:
`function <function_name>([<parameter_name_1>: <parameter_type_1>, ...])`
can match the following statement: `function my_func(a: int)`
as well as `function my_func(a: int, b: float)`.

""" General Definition

The proposal for class on **Fenix** presents the following structure:

```

[<visibility: public* | protected | private >] class <ClassName> [()|(<BaseClassName>, ...)]:
  [
    <docstring>
  ]

  [
  attributes:
    <attribute_name_1>: <visibility: [ public* | protected | private ]> [<mutability: mutable* | constant >] <attribute_type_1> [ = <default_value>]
    ...
  ]

  [
    methods:
      <method_name_1>([<mutability_parameter_1: mutable* | constant >] <parameter_name_1>: <parameter_type_1>, ... ]) [ -> <return_type> ]:
        <block_of_code>
        [return [<some_value>]]

      ...
  ]

```

Notes:
  - Visibility should be defined explicitly
  - Mutability should be defined explicitly
  - For private `[-]` and protected `[#]` attributes it is optional the usage
    of a `_` as prefix, e.g. `_attr1` or `_attr2`. Maybe it can
    help to improve the code readability.

"""# Core methods


**Initialization and Construction**

  - `__new__`(other)	To get called in an object's instantiation.
  - `__init__`(other)	To get called by the `__new__ method.
  - `__del__`()	Destructor method.

**Comparison core methods**

  - `__cmp__`(other) It is the most basic of the comparison magic methods.
    It actually implements behavior for all of the comparison operators (<, ==, !=, etc.)
  - `__eq__`(other)	To get called on comparison using == operator.
  - `__ge__`(other)	To get called on comparison using >= operator.
  - `__gt__`(other)	To get called on comparison using > operator.
  - `__lt__`(other)	To get called on comparison using < operator.
  - `__le__`(other)	To get called on comparison using <= operator.
  - `__ne__`(other)	To get called on comparison using != operator.


**Numeric Unary operators and functions**

  - `__pos__`()	To get called for unary positive e.g. +someobject.
  - `__neg__`()	To get called for unary negative e.g. -someobject.
  - `__abs__`()	To get called by built-in abs() function.
  - `__invert__`()	To get called for inversion using the ~ operator.
  - `__round__`(self,n)	To get called by built-in round() function.
  - `__floor__`()	To get called by built-in math.floor() function.
  - `__ceil__`()	To -  other)	To get called on integer division with assignment e.g. a //=b.


  - `__idiv__`(other)	To get called on division with assignment e.g. a /=b.
  - `__itruediv__`(other)	To get called on true division with assignment
  - `__imod__`(other)	To get called on modulo with assignment e.g. a%=b.
  - `__ipow__`(other)	To get called on exponentswith assignment e.g. a **=b.
  - `__ilshift__`(other)	To get called on left bitwise shift with assignment e.g. a<<=b.
  - `__irshift__`(other)	To get called on right bitwise shift with assignment e.g. a >>=b.
  - `__iand__`(other)	To get called on bitwise AND with assignment e.g. a&=b.
  - `__ior__`(other)	To get called on bitwise OR with assignment e.g. a|=b.
  - `__ixor__`(other)	To get called on bitwise XOR with assignment e.g. a ^=b.



**String Core Methods**
  - `__str__`()	To get called by built-int str() method to return a string representation of a type.
  - `__repr__`()	To get called by built-int repr() method to return a machine readable representation of a type.

**Attribute Core Methods**
  - `__getattr__`(name)	Is called when the accessing attribute of a class that does not exist.
  - `__setattr__`(name, value)	Is called when assigning a value to the attribute of a class.
